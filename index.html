                    High Fives founder Roy Tuscany
                    dedicates his life to giving back.

                        Even at idle, Roy Tuscany’s engine runs
                        at a high RPM.That thirst for speed contributed
                        to his life-altering injury in 2006,
                        when he over-revved his takeoff on a jump
                        at Mammoth Mountain—and overshot the landing.
                        His meteoric fall smashed his T12 vertebra
                        and relegated Tuscany to life as a paraplegic.

                        Yet 43 days later, Tuscany walked out
                        of the Reno hospital. Luck, surgeons,
                        rehab, and Tuscany’s positive attitude
                        revived the battered connection between his
                        spine and legs. Now 36, Tuscany has
                        channeled his upbeat energy into the
                        High Fives Foundation since 2009.
                        The Truckee-based nonprofit
                        and its Empowerment Fund
                        helps injured athletes pay for
                        living expenses,adaptive equipment,
                        and medical care. High Fives
                        operates out of the CR Johnson Healing
                        Center, which provides Truckee
                        area residents and High Fives athletes
                        with a 2,800 square-foot
                        training facility, physical therapy,
                        and a host of alternative medicines
                        (such as acupuncture and massage)
                        that many insurers won’t cover.
                        In its prevention role,High Fives
                        also conducts snow-safety
                        programs in local schools to help
                        kids make better decisions.
                        Its latest educational video
                        highlights the critical mistakes
                        made by five High Fives athletes.

                        All that good work doesn’t come free,
                        and as a nonprofit, High Fives
                        relies on donations. “Squaw Valley Alpine
                        Meadows is our largest corporate partner,”
                        says Tuscany. “Their contributions sustain
                        everything we do, and help spread our message
                        among their partners.”(Toyota and GoPro—both
                        Squaw Alpine resort partners—also
                        support High Fives.) But, says Tuscany,
                        the resort is the easiest to work with.
                        “Andy Wirth[Squaw Alpine’s President
                        and COO] called me up one day
                        and said, “I see you have this
                        tournament coming up. Do you need a
                        title sponsor?’ That’s… really … awesome.”
                        Disseminating stoke is also part
                        of High Fives’ mission, and
                        Tuscany’s spirit turns fundraisers
                        into riotous throwdowns—especially
                        the annual Squaw Valley Prom
                        on New Year’s Eve in the Olympic
                        Valley Lodge.“It’s is the best party in
                        all the land,” brags Tuscany.
